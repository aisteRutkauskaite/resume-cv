        "I am an ambitious and responsible designer seeking a career change to a position in web development. Currently, I am interested ininternship opportunities within the Front-End field. Earlier I was working in the interior design field. I enjoyed the creative work, which was technically too, but I feel a lack of perspectives in this area. I was always interested in innovation and learning, so I decided to change my career to a more dynamic and promising field.",
